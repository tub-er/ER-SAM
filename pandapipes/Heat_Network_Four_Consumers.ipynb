The pump feeds fluid of a given temperature into the grid. Due to losses, the temperature will fall. The 4 heat exchanger in combination with a flow controler represents a heat consumper which remove more heat from the network. On its way back to the pump, the temperature will fall further, but then rise again because of the warmer return flow from the first heat consumpers."
